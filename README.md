# A Project Phoenix Fork

-- READ HERE! --

Hey, original developer here. I abandoned DjStuff4 many months after. The original code needs heavy re-writes, so you have all freedom to re-write many elements of Phoenix's code to fix it up yourself.
If you wish to play with my files, you need InnoSetup to create the installers.
If you want to play with Toast's Files, you need Visual Basic 2010 Express. I haven't tested with other editions.

This edition was last relevant in June 2020. This is a 2022 save.




-- ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION --

On April 18th 2020, Certain Drama and Actions forced me to leave. I wanted to preserve the files for the expansion. That's when 2.0 was born. These are the files for Phoenix. From the beginning before Phoenix, 1.0 through 1.6 (and 1.6.1), all the way to 2.0 releases.
Enjoy.
